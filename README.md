# AI-IMU++ Dead-Reckoning [[IEEE paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9035481), [ArXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06064.pdf)]

<!-- _1.10%_ translational error on the [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) odometry sequences with __only__ an Inertial Measurement Unit.

## Overview

<small>ðŸ”¹In the context of intelligent vehicles, robust and accurate dead reckoning based on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) may prove useful to correlate feeds from imaging sensors, to safely navigate through obstructions, or for safe emergency stop in the extreme case of other sensors failure.</small>

This the repo of the [Sk "Perception in robotics"](https://github.com/g-ferrer/perception-in-robotics-2025) project. Our goal was to improve filter performance adding new pseudo-measurement model. 

You can inside the code you can find our "new" measurement function. For derivation and technical details check the paper.

## Method

![Structure of the approach](temp/structure.jpg)

The above figure illustrates the approach which consists of two main blocks summarized as follows:
1. the filter integrates the inertial measurements with exploits zero lateral and vertical velocity as measurements with covariance matrix to refine its estimates, see the figure below;
2. the noise parameter adapter determines in real-time the most suitable covariance noise matrix. This deep learning based adapter converts directly raw IMU signals into covariance matrices without requiring knowledge of any state estimate nor any other quantity.

## Code
Our implementation is done in Python. We use [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for the adapter block of the system. The code was tested under Python 3.5.
 
### Installation & Prerequies
1.  Install [pytorch](http://pytorch.org). We perform all training and testing on its development branch.
    
2.  Install the following required packages, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `termcolor`, `scipy`, `navpy`, e.g. with the pip3 command
```
pip3 install matplotlib numpy termcolor scipy navpy
```
or with conda:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai-imu
```

or with Docker:
```
docker build -t ai-imu .  
docker run --gpus all -it -v ($pwd):/project --rm ai-imu
``` 

inside container to activate env:
```
source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate ai-imu
```
4.  Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mbrossar/ai-imu-dr.git
```

### Testing
1. Download reformated pickle format of the 00-11 KITTI IMU raw data at this [url](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930695/data.zip), extract and copy then in the `data` folder.
```
wget "https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930695/data.zip"
mkdir ai-imu-dr/results
unzip data.zip -d ai-imu-dr
rm data.zip
```
These file can alternatively be generated after download the KITTI raw data and setting `read_data = 1` in the `main.py` file.

2. Download training parameters at this [url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10yHLJ8MNgufN8MrOZeku661EyP4M9orz/view?usp=sharing)(low number of epochs), extract and copy in the `temp` folder.
```
wget "https://github.com/DragonEmperorG/ai-imu-dr/raw/refs/heads/master/temp/temp.zip"
unzip temp.zip -d ai-imu-dr/temp
rm temp.zip
```
4. Test the filters !
```
mkdir ai-imu-dr/results
cd ai-imu-dr/src
python3 main_kitti.py
```
This first launches the filters for the all sequences. Then, results are plotted. Note that the parameters are  trained on sequences 00, 01, 04-11, so only sequence 02 is a test sequence.

### Training
You can train for testing another sequence (we do not find difference in the results) or for our own sequence by modifying the dataset class.
